## Overview

Sunbird Lern is an enterprise-grade learning infrastructure service designed for high-scale educational ecosystems. It serves as the authoritative engine for managing user identities, orchestrating structured learning journeys, and facilitating data-driven educational workflows within the Sunbird platform.

The service is deployed as part of the **learnbb** umbrella Helm chart, which coordinates Lern alongside supporting infrastructure including Redis caching, Elasticsearch search, Kafka messaging, and YugabyteDB persistence.

---

## Key Modules

The service is composed of four primary functional modules:

| Module | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **UserOrg** | Identity and Organization management — SSO, RBAC, managed users, bulk onboarding. |
| **LMS** | Learning Management — course batches, enrollment, progress tracking, competency assessment. |
| **Notification** | Multi-channel communication — Email, in-app feeds, SMS triggers with dynamic templating. |
| **Lern Service** | Unified aggregator bundling UserOrg, LMS, and Notification into a single runtime. |

Shared abstractions across modules reside in **core**: telemetry, Pekko actors, database drivers, and Elasticsearch utilities.

---

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Identity & Organization Management (UserOrg)
*   **Identity Lifecycle:** End-to-end management of user accounts, including self-signup, managed users, and bulk onboarding.
*   **Authentication & SSO:** Native support for OpenID Connect (OIDC), Google SSO, and federated identity providers.
*   **RBAC & Governance:** Granular Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) across complex organizational hierarchies.

### 2. Learning Management (LMS)
*   **Batch Orchestration:** Lifecycle management of course batches (Invite-only, Open, and Private).
*   **Progress & Tracking:** Real-time tracking of content consumption and competency-based progress.
*   **Credentialing:** Rule-based engine for automated generation and issuance of digital certificates.

### 3. Notification Engine
*   **Multi-Channel Delivery:** Orchestrated delivery via Email, SMS, and In-App Activity Feeds.
*   **Template Management:** Dynamic, localized template engine for transactional communications.

---

## Technical Stack

Lern is engineered using a reactive, non-blocking architecture:

*   **Runtime:** Java 11 (LTS), Scala 2.13.12
*   **Web Engine:** Play Framework 3.0.5
*   **Reactive Core:** Apache Pekko 1.0.3 (Distributed Actor System)
*   **Data Persistence:** 
    *   **YugabyteDB:** Dual-driver architecture — Cassandra (9042) for document stores, Postgres (5433) for relational data.
    *   **Elasticsearch:** Distributed full-text search engine (9200).
    *   **Redis:** Optional distributed cache layer.
*   **Messaging:** Apache Kafka (9092) for event-driven workflows and notification dispatch.
*   **Build System:** Maven 3.8.0+

---

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed and verified:
*   **Java 11** — `java -version`
*   **Maven 3.8.0+** — `mvn -version`
*   **Docker Desktop** — `docker --version` (6GB RAM minimum recommended)
*   **Git** — `git --version`

---

## Local Development Setup

### Step 1 — Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sunbird-lern/lern-service.git
cd lern-service
```

### Step 2 — Start Infrastructure
Spin up YugabyteDB, Elasticsearch, and Kafka using Docker Compose:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose ps
```
Wait up to 60 seconds for all services to be fully ready, then verify all show `Up` status before proceeding.

### Step 2a — Initialize Database & Elasticsearch

Run these once after the containers are up for the first time. They pull migration scripts from external repos and apply them to your local instances.

**YugabyteDB schema migrations:**
```bash
chmod +x init-yugabyte.sh
./init-yugabyte.sh
```

**Elasticsearch index setup:**
```bash
chmod +x init-elasticsearch.sh
./init-elasticsearch.sh
```

> These scripts require Docker to be running with the `yugabyte` and `sunbird_es` containers healthy. You only need to run them once — re-running on an already-initialized instance is safe.

### Step 3 — Configure Environment
Copy the template, fill in your values, and source it:
```bash
cp scripts/env-variables.example .env
source .env
```
Edit `.env` with your local credentials before sourcing.

The service reads all configuration from environment variables at startup. They must be sourced in the **same terminal session** before starting the service. Key variables to verify:

Elasticsearch — these must be **lowercase**:
```bash
sunbird_es_host="localhost"
sunbird_es_port="9200"
sunbird_es_cluster="sunbird"
```

YugabyteDB:
```bash
SUNBIRD_CASSANDRA_HOST="localhost"
SUNBIRD_CASSANDRA_PORT="9042"
SUNBIRD_POSTGRES_HOST="localhost"
SUNBIRD_POSTGRES_PORT="5433"
```

Kafka:
```bash
SUNBIRD_KAFKA_URL="localhost:9092"
```

### Step 4 — Build the Project
Run the unified build script (recommended):
```bash
./scripts/build-local.sh --service lern
```
> For all build options (CSP, running tests, building other services), see [scripts/README.md](scripts/README.md).

Or build manually:
```bash
mvn clean install -DskipTests -P lern
cd modules/lern/service
mvn play2:dist
```

### Step 5 — Run the Service

**On Linux:**
```bash
cd modules/lern/service
mvn play2:run
```

**On macOS** — Netty's native transport (epoll) is Linux-only. Two changes are required:

**1. Change `transport` in all four module configs** from `"native"` to `"jdk"`:
- [modules/lern/service/conf/application.conf](modules/lern/service/conf/application.conf)
- [modules/lms/service/conf/application.conf](modules/lms/service/conf/application.conf)
- [modules/notification/service/conf/application.conf](modules/notification/service/conf/application.conf)
- [modules/userorg/controller/conf/application.conf](modules/userorg/controller/conf/application.conf)

**2. Run via the built distribution** (the Play2 Maven plugin's file watcher fails on macOS):
```bash
cd modules/lern/service/target
unzip lern-service-impl-1.0-SNAPSHOT-dist.zip
cd lern-service-impl-1.0-SNAPSHOT
./start -Dhttp.port=9000
```

### Step 6 — Verify
```bash
curl http://localhost:9000/health
```
Expected response:
```json
{
  "id": "api.all.health",
  "ver": "health",
  "params": { "status": "SUCCESS", "err": null },
  "responseCode": "OK",
  "result": {
    "response": {
      "checks": [
        { "name": "Learner service", "healthy": true },
        { "name": "Actor service", "healthy": true },
        { "name": "Cassandra service", "healthy": true },
        { "name": "Elastic search service", "healthy": true }
      ],
      "healthy": true,
      "name": "Complete health check api"
    }
  }
}
```

## Optional Features

### Redis Caching
Redis is optional and disabled by default. To enable it, set the following environment variables:

```bash
export sunbird_redis_host=localhost
export sunbird_redis_port=6379
```

Then change `redis.enabled` from `false` to `true` in [modules/lern/service/conf/application.conf](modules/lern/service/conf/application.conf):

```
redis.enabled = true
```

This config key cannot be set via an environment variable (dots are invalid in bash variable names), so the application.conf edit is required.

### Cloud Storage Configuration

Lern requires cloud storage for certificates, user artifacts, and content objects. Configure one of the following providers before deployment.

> For local development, set `sunbird_cloud_storage_auth_type=ACCESS_KEY` and provide the account key. The default auth type is `OIDC` (Kubernetes Workload Identity) which does not require a key but is only applicable in a Kubernetes environment.

#### Azure Blob Storage (Default)
```bash
export sunbird_cloud_service_provider=azure
export sunbird_cloud_storage_auth_type=ACCESS_KEY
export sunbird_account_name=your-account-name
export sunbird_account_key=your-account-key
export sunbird_content_cloud_storage_container=your-container-name
```

#### AWS S3
```bash
export sunbird_cloud_service_provider=aws
export sunbird_cloud_storage_auth_type=ACCESS_KEY
export sunbird_account_name=your-access-key-id
export sunbird_account_key=your-secret-access-key
export sunbird_content_cloud_storage_container=your-s3-bucket-name
```

#### Google Cloud Storage
```bash
export sunbird_cloud_service_provider=gcloud
export sunbird_cloud_storage_auth_type=ACCESS_KEY
export sunbird_account_name=your-client-email
export sunbird_account_key=/path/to/key.json
export sunbird_content_cloud_storage_container=your-gcs-bucket-name
```
